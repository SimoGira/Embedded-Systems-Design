### Compilation
In order to compile you need to download the SystemC and SystemC-AMS libraries and set and export the follow enviroment variables to point to the right path where libraries are located:

* SCAMS_HOME
* SYSTEMC_HOME

For example you can set SYSTEMC_HOME="/home/ubuntu/pse_libraries/systemc" and SCAMS_HOME="/home/ubuntu/pse_libraries/systemc-ams"
To simplify you can add them to the .bashrc (for Ubuntu) and .bash_profile (for Mac OS)
